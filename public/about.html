<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Altis Jessie Niño DP. Dulay. I am a person who loves to program in my free time. I believe that every one of us has the chance to change the world, especially with the right motivation and determination to succeed.</p>

<p>I’ve been studying programming for more than 4 years now as a self-taught programmer. Teaching has always been one of my passions, and I realized that it aligns perfectly with programming. That’s when I thought, “Why not teach programming?” Sharing what I know motivates me to help others achieve their goals while reinforcing my own understanding..</p>

<p>Now, I am dedicated to teaching beginners, helping them reach their dreams of becoming better programmers. Every time I create a course topic, I learn something new, which inspires me to keep going. Teaching others is not just about sharing knowledge — it’s also about continuous learning and growth. Thank you!</p>
